For my hypothesis, I wanted to find out if percentages of driver involved in fatal collisions who were alcohol-impaired may have influence on the percentages of driver involved in fatal collisions who were speeding.

The outcome of my EDA was that there was no significant relationship between these two variables since the p-value was 0.491 which is > 0.05, it failed to reject the null hypothesis. The percentages of driver involve in fatal collisions who were speeding will can increase or decrease in the event of with or without alcohol-impairment. However, as for correlation from scatter plot result, there is a what seems like a very weak positive correlation between these two variables, but it is to weak and there are many other confounding factors to determine any significance or infer causation between these two variables.
